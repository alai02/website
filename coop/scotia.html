				* Learning Goal 1: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis
				
				* Goal: Data Science is a new field that has been developed out of being able to track large 
					amounts of data. During this co-op term I will strive to learn how the Data Science team 
					tracks, manages, and utilizes the data that is collected.
				
				* Action Plan: I will achieve this goal by consistently asking questions about the process 
					the team uses as well as analyzing both how and why the team does what they do.
				
				* Measure of Success: The level of success will be measured by my ability to apply the 
					concepts I learned to future projects.
					Reflection: Reflecting on this goal, I believe I am satisfied with what I learned about 
					the data science team and am confident in my ability to apply these new skills to future 
					projects. I learned that the Data Science Team is composed of many sub teams who do very 
					different jobs. I was mainly exposed to the web analytics team where I learned how to use 
					analytics software and how the development process works within the team to deliver 
					powerful analytics to shareholders.
				
				<div><br></div>
				
				* Learning Goal 2: COMMUNICATING - Oral Communication
				
				* Goal: In my role I will have a variety of teams to interact with since the data science 
					teams manages data that can benefit many different aspects of the company. My goal is to 
					develop strong oral communication skills to be able to communicate both technical and non 
					technical information to the various teams so I can help the teams understand the data so 
					they can utilise it to the best of their ability.
				
					* Action Plan: My plan to achieve this goal is to learn from how my team interacts with the 
					various other teams we provide data and services for. Also I will collect feedback as to how 
					well I am delivering information in meetings or presentations.
				* Measure of Success: To measure the success of this goal I am going reflect on the feedback 
					as well as my ability to confidently deliver and explain information throughout the work term.
					Reflection: Reflecting on this goal, I did improve on my oral communication skills in this role. 
					I had weekly meetings where I would explain and discuss technical information to many teams 
					who wanted to know how their products were performing. I would present them with my results 
					and explain to them how it impacts them and what key points they should take away from the 
					information. This constant exposure helped me with both my confidence and ability to deliver 
					information in a meaningful way.
				
				<div><br></div>
				
				* Learning Goal 3: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving

				* Goal: Problem Solving is a skill that we work on continuously throughout life and is more 
					challenging when learning new concepts since it is more difficult to utilise techniques in 
					new areas. My goal is to develop strong problem solving skills related to data science.
				
				* Action Plan 3: The plan I am going to use to achieve this goal is to learn about techniques 
					that my team uses in order to solve new problems as well as challenge myself in the problems 
					that I face to uncover new strategies that will help me in my role. I will also reflect on 
					recent projects and figure out what could have been done better in retrospect.
				
				* Measure of Success: The success of this role will be measured by my confidence level in 
					tackling new problems and being able to deliver projects successfully that are completely 
					new to me. I will also have an increase in efficiency when working on similar problems that 
					I have had previous experience with.
					Reflection: Reflecting on this goal, I am happy with how much I learned about how the process 
					of web analytics works and this has increased my problem solving ability greatly. Exposure and practice are very important to learning how to problem solve in new areas. Once you learn how processes work, you can figure out where problems are occuring and solve problems quicker.
