				For my final Co-op work term during the summer of 2019 I moved to a different team in the Data Science department with my new role as a Full Stack Developer.
				Where I worked on an Internal Search Engine application called Find.BNS.
				<div><br></div>
				This web page contains insight about the Scotiabank and my impact on the company during this Co-op term.
			</div>
			
			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-about" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-about-tab">
				Scotiabank is the 3rd largest bank in Canada as well as a multinational bank servicing people across the world.
				With 25 million customers, 88 thousand employees, and almost 100 billion in assets, Scotiabank is a massive company to say the least.
				I worked in a building called the Digital located downtown Toronto which is where Scotiabank is building out 
				many of their new digital platforms. Including their brand new released mobile banking app.
				<div><br></div>
				I worked under the Digital Data and Analytics CoP for the Internal Search Engine Team.
				The team consisted of 5 members including myself all working on Find.BNS
				Find.BNS is an Internal Search Engine for the bank where employees go to find bank documents and information.
			</div>
			
			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-job" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-job-tab">
				My role on the team was mainly focused on building a new section of the application dedicated to Scotiabanks Art Collection.
				To provide some background information, Scotiabank owns an extensive art collection of approximatly 2000 works.
				The art collection data was stored in a database and my task was to make that data searchable and presentable 
				to any member of the bank. The bank has many locations and would like to display the art collection in various building but 
				employees have no way to find which art works they would like to request for their building. With this project, 
				every bank employee will be able to discover the Scotiabank Art Collection and request art works to be hung up/ displayed at thier location.
				<div><br></div>
				This task came with a lot of challenges as well as new learning experiences.
				The first part of this project consisted of gathering and curating the data into a format that we could
				index into the search engine in a meaningful way. I developed a console Java application for this task which 
				takes in the art collection data from various data points and outputs a clean and indexable document of the entire art collection 
				data. 
				<div><br></div>
				The other main task was to expand the Find.BNS application to support the new art collection.
				This consisted of both rewriting existing code and expanding the code base with new features to support the nuances of the art project.
				The application is built with React and Node.js which connects to the search engine powered by Apache Solr.

				Goals...
			</div>
			
			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-conclusions" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-conclusions-tab">
				In conclusion I thuroughly enjoyed my role and the project overall. 
				We were able to release the first version of the project to the bank and present 
				it to the employees at the Digital Factory within a few months.
				<div><br></div>
				I learned new skills, technologies and gained experience which I will take with me and apply to my next project.
				
			</div>
			
			<div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-acknowledgments" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-acknowledgments-tab">
				First, I would like to thank Yannick Lallement, the teams director.
				Yannick was the person who made it possible for myself to move into this new and exciting role.
				He has been extremely supportive and encourging the entire duration of my term as well as a 
				friendly and interesting person to talk to.
				<div><br></div>
				Next, I would like to thank my manager Michael Portnoy, Micheal introduced me to the project and was an excellent leader throughout the term.
				He put a lot of thought and effort into the design and creation of the project which is why I believe it was successful. 
				Micheal provided guidence in all aspects of the project, from the business side all the way to the technical side 
				he was able to always give great insights and direction for the project.
				<div><br></div>
				Last but not least, I am thankfull for the two other developers on the team Dean Pearce and Oleksandr Zhurbenko. 
				They are both very talented individuals who were essential in my success in this role. Both Dean and Oleksandr were always 
				able to answer any questions I had about the software as well as provide me with further insights towards the industry as a whole. 
				A lot of the tools and technologies I used were new to me and they helped make learning an enjoyable and intersting experience.
				<div><br></div>
				Overall I had an excellent experience working with this team and cannot thank them enough for the oppertunity.
