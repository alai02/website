They are well known for their generosity in giving back to the community and having a strong commitment to stability. The group was founded on farmers who dreamed of building a co-operative insurance company to protect their assets for future generations.\n\nThe Co-operators are a multi-line insurer, offering auto, home, life, farm, travel, business and investment insurances."},jobinfo:{title:"Job Information",content:"During my work term at this company I was apart of a very small team that was working on an upgrade project of older web services and applications that the company wanted to maintain and upgrade to their newest backend database IBM's Master data management (MDM 11.4).\n\nI was tasked with upgrading 7 of the applications. The upgrade was broken down into a few major steps. The first step was configuring the application in a local workspace, fixing bugs in the code and managing and configuring libraries and utilities that were either out dated or needed adjustments. I also needed to add and change code for the XML requests created in the code that are used to send information to the database since the format changed with the new database (MDM11.4). The second step was to deploy the application and test the new transactions/request that the new database used on my local server to verify if the application was working correctly and did not need further changes. The next step was to rewrite the build scripts with the new configurations of the applications and new dev server. The last step was to deploy the applications to the new unix server that was hosting the newer version of Web Sphere.\n\nThe most challenging part of the role was working with legacy software that is no longer supported with both the database and web server that we were upgrading to. The applications that we were upgrading were built across several years and used varying libraries and utilities. Since the Co-operators have many applications they do not upgrade their software every time IBM releases the next version since development is costly and most of the time the cost to effort does not make sense from a business perspective."},goals:{title:"Goals & Learning",content:"I created 3 goals for myself to achieve and I am happy with my progression through the term and can confidently say that it was successful.\n\nThe first goal I set out for myself was to learn how to accurately estimate time to complete tasks which was is an important focus of this cooperation. The company is very large making it complicated for managers to stay updated and ensure the high performance and future success. Throughout the work term I had a meeting every Monday with my team and our resource manager to talk about progress and discuss how much effort is being put into each task and the expected results of them. This was a proactive strategy to ensure that we were always making the right decisions at the right time and making sure that we weren't allocating resources to tasks that were not of the highest priority and in the wrong direction of the overall target. At the beginning of the term I quickly found out that I had a hard time gauging how long it would take me to complete a task, especially with technology that I had never worked with before and was not aware of the possible roadblocks I would run into. The learning curve was exciting and by the end of the term I was pleased with my new developed skill of being able to measure out length to complete tasks with much greater accuracy. This is a very important skill in the professional workplace as it helps with time management and ability to plan out a successful work week.\n\nThe second goal I set out for my self was to outsource and discover new technologies and tools that would improve my workflow. Since I was working with legacy applications, I decided it would be very helpful to always be searching for better tools that would improve my ability to develop and test my work. The integrated development environment (IDE) that we were using was very slow and outdated and our application was extremely large which made development slower than what I have been used to. One change that I did was using a light weight editor to develop in. This made code changes and searching for information much more efficient. Another tool that I used was a built-in script tester that improved my ability to quickly test SOAP messages, I found a IDE plug in that would allow me to run the scripts right from the editor which was great for testing many transactions. An issue that we ran into for one of our UI applications was that the front-end code was written in an outdated version of a language called Java server pages (JSP). The specific problem was that some of the UI components were not supported on the latest browsers. I was able to find a tool that supported the code which was a great help to my team and myself. This discovery helped us pinpoint the exact issue and later resulted in my team member finding a work around for the upgrade.\n\nThe last goal that I created for myself was to improve the existing code base wherever I could and add meaningful documentation to help future developers. The legacy applications were very large and were worked on by many developers throughout the past 10-15 years. This inevitably lead to varying code and a lot of configuration issues, making it hard to make large changes to project. Since there was a lot of future testing within multiple environments after I finished the development of the applications I figured it was important to provide information about the changes I made and why I made them. I was tasked with creating documentation for each application I worked on that would help the next developer or tester with all the different configurations I had to do to upgrade the application and give them a head start with information on how and what to test. I learned that consistency is very important within large projects and is often better to maintain that consistency rather than using your own style, even if you think its better. It helps with someone's ability to understand the code and add to it, creating a robust stability and consistency within the project."},conclusions:{title:"Conclusions",content:"I had a very successful and enjoyable term and am moving forward with a great respect for The Co-operators and how they run their company. I learned a lot of important things and that will assist me going forward. Especially learning how to work with legacy code. There are many systems out there that are built and rely on legacy code which means that it is not going anywhere anytime soon. Learning how to develop and maintain legacy code is a great asset and I am grateful for the opportunity that was presented to me. Throughout the term I gained experience learning about large corporations and how they function. I found it very interesting that there were so many that were being used in the development process. This was necessary since there were many teams working in parallel and required different regions to test and develop the products. This was very eye opening to how different the work environment is compared to smaller companies. I am sure this will help me choose my next position since I now have worked in two very different environments and can see the pros and cons of each.\n\nThe most interesting thing that I will take away was learning how large java web applications are built which was a challenging new experience. The services that The Co-operators use are based on IBM core products that serve as the foundation of the customized services that became the Customer Information File (CIF) which is what we were upgrading. I needed to adapt to working with the IBM software since the development process is quite different than a traditional process. It was challenging because the code was no longer supported by IBM and discovering work arounds became a much more involved process and many road blocks were often present."},acknowledgments:{title:"Acknowledgments",content:"I would like to give a special thanks to John Tessaro who was the lead on the project I was working on and was an incredible help in my ability to help in the long process of the upgrade project. He gave me great insights on how the software's worked and was able to easily explain each application at both a high and low level to help me with my overall understanding of the software. He was also able give me many tips and tricks that he has learned after working with the software for so long that would have been very hard to learn with such a complex project that was the CIF/MDM project. I would also like to thank Martin Fielding who was an incredible manager and leader to our team. He displayed very knowledgeable skills in pushing our team forward and making sure everyone was always comfortable and in a smart working environment.

The automation development team was composed of myself and 2 others as well as an offshore team that was working on separate components of the same program. Our role was to automate the testing of the iCA. The tools used for this development was a C# console application that we developed the automated tests in. I had a development environment with the latest version of iCA installed as well as a client machine that the tests were run on. We used Smart Bears technology called Test Execute which is an API that helped us interface with the web application and automate the steps in the test cases we developed. We used a software called Jira to keep track of our tasks and record progress of the development. We also used another application created by Smart Bear called QAComplete to create and manage the tests as well as keep track of the execution results of those tests.\n\nThe other role I had was manual testing the final release of the 7.0 Version of the iCA software. This consisted of a larger team of about 10 people whose goal was to insure the release version of the newest software was ready for production. The process we took to test the software consisted of running through test sets that were created in QAComplete and executing them on the latest build of the application. This process is extensive and one of the goals of the automation team is to lower and hopefully one day eliminate the need for manual testing.\n\nEach week the teams would get together and discuss progress of the project as well as any questions, issues or concerns regarding ongoing or future tasks. This was a very efficient and informative way of keeping track of each person's progress which helped management's ability to plan the overall completion of the project and move things around to help everyone work to the best of their ability.\n\nThe main skills I required to be successful in this job was to be able to learn quickly, ask questions about features or procedures I was not familiar with, and a strong background in development and testing software. I have been working on all of these skills during each work term as well as my semesters at school."},goals:{title:"Goals & Learning",content:"I set out 3 goals for myself at the beginning of my co-op term to be able to measure my progress and success in my role at the company.\n\nThe first goal I created for myself was to develop a deep understanding of the software and technologies used in my teams. I believe I developed this goal each and every day as I consistently worked with new features of the application which resulted in a greater understanding of how the software worked as a whole as well as how each feature of the application worked individually. The aspect of my role which contributed the most to this goal was the manual testing of the application. I learned how each feature worked as well as what to test in order to ensure the feature is working correctly. I also learned a lot about how test automation software works. More specifically I learned the process of how to automate a test as well as what technologies are required to automate work. This is a skill that I am very happy I was able to learn and believe has a lot of value in a variety of industries as a developer. The exact automation software we used was not very important but the way we interfaced with the software to get the results we needed are things I am very glad I learned as a result of my goal.\n\nThe next goal I set out for myself was to further develop my team working skills and ensure that I was always working in a positive learning environment. This goal was important to me as I believe it is essential in learning throughout the work term. This goal was developed through communicating in various mediums with members of the team. Furthering this skill is important to my success in the future because people work best in environments that they feel comfortable in and overall produce better results. Some of the technologies I used to work on this goal was IBM's internal email and messaging application called notes which allowed me to connect with teammates at any time. I also frequently went over to my coworkers desks to discuss work in person which helped develop my connections and communicate ideas in a stronger way. I was successful in this goal because by the end of the term I knew exactly who to speak to so I could get the best information possible. I also found that working with my coworkers more closely allowed us to solve problems faster because we had more heads working together.\n\nThe third goal I created for myself was to work on learning the language of the technologies I was using in order to communicate with coworkers at a more indepth level. At the beginning of the work term I felt overwhelmed with the amount of new words and acronyms used to talk about the product and workflow which made some things feel unclear at first. I made it a goal for myself to be fluent in the product and technologies I was using in order to better communicate and understand others when talking about our work. Medical software is something completely new to me and a large amount of the tools had names that were foreign to me which made it harder to talk about the software. For example DICOM tags and the CINE tool were just words without meaning to me. I ensured that I wrote down everything I wasn't sure about whenever I learned new things as well as keeping notes of how certain tools work and how they are configured. This allowed me to have notes to refer back to as well as giving me the ability to google certain things at a later time and become more familiar with them. I believe I was successful in this role as I felt comfortable talking with anyone about aspects of my work and felt I was able to communicate smoother and talk more specifically about features we were using. This is an ongoing skill that I will continue to improve as I work with new technologies."},conclusions:{title:"Conclusions",content:"One thing that I have thought about as I complete this work term is being able to compare and contrast the companies that I have worked at and learn what are the specific similarities and differences they have. This allows me to bring new ideas to future employers when I find something a company does really well. It also allows me to learn more about myself and what type of job I want in the future and what type of career path I want to take.\n\nAnother thing that I am glad I can take away from this experience is test automation development. I have learned the importance of automation and how it is making the lives of people easier as well as increase the amount of tasks that can be completed in a shorter time. I also learned the importance of rigorous software testing before releasing a product. It takes a lot of resources to completely test a product and have a high confidence that the product will perform well in the real world.\n\nOverall I am happy with the outcome of the work term and feel I accomplished a great amount in the short few months.

I had weekly meetings where I would explain and discuss technical information to many teams who wanted to know how their products were performing. I would present them with my results and explain to them how it impacts them and what key points they should take away from the information. This constant exposure helped me with both my confidence and ability to deliver information in a meaningful way.\n\nProblem Solving is a skill that we work on continuously throughout life and is more challenging when learning new concepts since it is more difficult to utilise techniques in new areas.

During my work term I created many components of the Titan website and wrote many database routes that allow the client side of the application to interact with the data on the server.\n\nAlso I was tasked with finding and resolving bugs that the current system had as well as Updating and rewriting older components that have become outdated compared to the latest platform standards. On the front end I was using Typescript for the website logic as well as scss and html to create the visual interface that the user will interact with while using the application. For the server side I was creating database requests using php but quickly switched to using NodeJS for its many advantages. The types of features and bugs that I worked on varied as the platform needed a lot of unique features and since we had a small team, I was responsible for a wide variety of tasks.\n\nSince there are so many interesting software stacks with each having their own benefit, I was required to have the ability to learn new things and adapt to new APIs and Frameworks to succeed in my role. I would say my greatest challenge that I had during my work term was having to read and understand existing code which is something that I had not done before until this summer. This was difficult because it is hard to jump right in to a project that is so large. I found the best strategy to learn from someone else's code and be able to understand it to the point to be able to add and manipulate it was to follow the code and use the rubber duck ideology to simplify the program and make it easier to understand. Also something that helped me greatly was using the same resources that the developers had used to learn the platform themselves which was quite helpful as I developed a similar grasp of how to structure the code in a way that allowed for the entire application to have a uniform code consistency and style."},goals:{title:"Goals & Learning",content:"The first goal i created for myself in this role was to become proficient with using Git since it was a very large part of how I would control my code and maintain it in the best way possible.

Debugging can slow down progress greatly in any project and building on this skill will help any programmers overall ability to code. I had many opportunities to further my debugging skills in this position with various bugs I worked on and can confidently say I am a better programmer because of it.

It is extremely important to be interested in the platform and ready to learn new things each and every day. The exact tools and languages that the company uses should not make a difference on how the problem is approached. Being open minded and wanting to learn as much as possible will result in a more creative and thoughtful solution. Everyone makes mistakes when learning a new tool but once it has been mastered, it will make the next tool easier and faster to learn.

The bank has many locations and would like to display the art collection in various building but employees have no way to find which art works they would like to request for their building. With this project, every bank employee will be able to discover the Scotiabank Art Collection and request art works to be hung up/ displayed at their location.\n\nThis task came with a lot of challenges as well as new learning experiences. The first part of this project consisted of gathering and curating the data into a format that we could index into the search engine in a meaningful way. I developed a console Java application for this task which takes in the art collection data from various data points and outputs a clean and indexable document of the entire art collection data.\n\nThe other main task was to expand the Find.BNS application to support the new art collection. This consisted of both rewriting existing code and expanding the code base with new features to support the nuances of the art project. The application is built with React and Node.js which connects to the search engine powered by Apache Solr.\n\nAfter getting the first main prototype working, I spent my time improving the data pipeline, working on new UI features, and documenting the process."},conclusions:{title:"Conclusions",content:"In conclusion, I found the project both challenging and interesting which is exactly what I hoped for during this Co-op term. I joined a great team, worked through many new problems and built a great new section of the application.\n\nWe were able to release the first version of the project to production and present the new web page to the employees at the Digital Factory within a few months. I was able to implement some new features through the art application process and also improve some of the existing code of the document search portion of the application.\n\nThe Find.BNS team gave me the opportunity to work with many new technologies and participate in a new and unique development process. I have learned a lot from both my team as well as the project itself and am excited to take this information with me moving forward."},acknowledgments:{title:"Acknowledgments",content:"First, I would like to thank Yannick Lallement, a director in our team. Yannick was the person who made it all possible for myself to move into this new and exciting role. He has been extremely supportive and encouraging the entire duration of my term.\n\nNext, I would like to thank my manager Michael Portnoy, Micheal introduced me to the project and was an excellent leader throughout the term. He put a lot of thought and effort into the design and creation of the project which is why I believe it was successful. Micheal provided guidance in all aspects of the project, from the business side all the way to the technical side he was able to always give great insights and direction for the project.\n\nLast but not least, I am thankful for the two other developers on the team Dean Pearce and Oleksandr Zhurbenko. They are both very talented individuals who were essential in my success in this role. Both Dean and Oleksandr were always able to answer any questions I had about the software as well as provide me with further insights towards the industry as a whole. A lot of the tools and technologies I used were new to me and they helped make learning an enjoyable experience.\n\nOverall I had an excellent experience working with this team and cannot thank them enough for the opportunity."}}}};function h(e){let{id:t}=e,a=l[t],[h,d]=(0,n.useState)("introduction");if(!a)return(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-white",children:[(0,o.jsx)(s.default,{}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"pt-32 text-center",children:(0,o.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900",children:"Experience not found"})}),(0,o.jsx)(r.default,{})]});let c=Object.entries(a.sections),m=a.sections[h];return(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-white",children:[(0,o.jsx)(s.default,{}),(0,o.jsxs)("main",{className:"pt-16",children:[(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"bg-gradient-to-r ".concat(a.accentColorClass," py-16 text-white"),children:(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8 text-center",children:[(0,o.jsx)("h1",{className:"font-display font-bold text-5xl lg:text-6xl mb-4",children:a.company}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{className:"text-xl mb-2",children:a.role}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{className:"text-white/80",children:a.period})]})}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"py-16 lg:py-20",children:(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8",children:[(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"mb-12 overflow-x-auto",children:(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"flex gap-2 min-w-max lg:flex-wrap",children:c.map(e=>{let[t,n]=e;return(0,o.jsx)("button",{onClick:()=>d(t),className:"px-4 py-2 rounded-lg font-medium transition-all duration-300 whitespace-nowrap ".concat(h===t?"bg-gradient-to-r ".concat(a.accentColorClass," text-white"):"bg-gray-100 text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-200"),children:n.title},t)})})}),(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"prose prose-lg max-w-none",children:[(0,o.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-3xl font-bold mb-6 bg-gradient-to-r ".concat(a.accentColorClass," bg-clip-text text-transparent"),children:m.title}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"text-gray-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap",children:m.content})]}),(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"mt-16 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200",children:(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex justify-between items-center",children:[(0,o.jsx)(i.default,{href:"/#experience",className:"text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-900 transition-colors",children:"← Back to all experiences"}),(0,o.jsx)(i.default,{href:"/#experience",className:"px-6 py-3 rounded-lg bg-primary text-white font-semibold hover:bg-gray-900 transition-colors",children:"View main portfolio"})]})})]})})]}),(0,o.jsx)(r.default,{})]})}},2834:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,{default:function(){return i}});var o=a(7437),n=a(7648);function i(){let e=new Date().getFullYear();return(0,o.jsx)("footer",{className:"bg-primary text-white py-12 lg:py-16",children:(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"max-w-6xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8",children:[(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"grid md:grid-cols-5 gap-8 mb-8",children:[(0,o.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,o.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex items-center gap-2 mb-4",children:[(0,o.jsx)("div",{className:"w-8 h-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-secondary to-orange-600 rounded-lg flex items-center justify-center",children:(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:"text-white font-bold",children:"A"})}),(0,o.jsx)("span",{className:"font-bold text-lg",children:"Alex Lai"})]}),(0,o.jsx)("p",{className:"text-gray-400 text-sm",children:"Engineering the future with code"})]}),(0,o.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,o.jsx)("h3",{className:"font-semibold mb-4",children:"Navigation"}),(0,o.jsxs)("ul",{className:"space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-400",children:[(0,o.jsx)("li",{children:(0,o.jsx)("a",{href:"#about",className:"hover:text-white transition-colors",children:"About"})}),(0,o.jsx)("li",{children:(0,o.jsx)("a",{href:"#experience",className:"hover:text-white transition-colors",children:"Experience"})}),(0,o.jsx)("li",{children:(0,o.jsx)("a",{href:"#projects",className:"hover:text-white transition-colors",children:"Projects"})})]})]}),(0,o.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,o.jsx)("h3",{className:"font-semibold mb-4 text-xs uppercase tracking-wide",children:"Co-op Archive"}),(0,o.jsx)("ul",{className:"space-y-2 text-xs text-gray-400",children:[{title:"v-Eden",slug:"veden"},{title:"The Cooperators",slug:"cooperators"},{title:"IBM Watson Health",slug:"ibm"},{title:"Scotiabank (2019)",slug:"scotia"},{title:"Scotiabank (2019 -
